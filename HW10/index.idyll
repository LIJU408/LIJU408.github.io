## Introduction

This idyll webpage is for describing [GSP Dataset](https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/is445_AOUAOG_fall2021/week01/data/GDP.csv). You can download it via the embedded hyperlink. 

## Do you know the importance of GDP? 

It is one of key metrics to measure the health of one country's economy.

So some tricks like the `code brackets` were used here!  (Other HTML div elements are also available).

## How to define GDP?

According to [this website](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp), Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the finished goods and services produced within a countryâ€™s borders in a specific time period.

## The table of GDP Dataset

[data name:"corgsTime" source:"GDP.csv" /]

[Table data:corgsTime /]

## The Chart of the data

[Chart type:"time" data:`corgsTime` domain:`null` range:`null` x:'Date' y:"GDP" /]

Chart is a nice quick way to look at data, but we probably want to do something fancier.


## Description of Dataset
I got the GDP dataset from IS445 course website. 

The dataset measures monthly GDP data of USA from 1947 to 2019. It includes two columns: Date and GDP. 


My components in this idyll website helped me to better demonstrate dataset in two ways: 
*  Give some background knowledge arond GDP, including GDP definition, big events happening in USA GDP history. 
* Display the GDP data in multiple ways, via table and chart.
